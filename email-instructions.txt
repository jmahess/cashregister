I'm sending you the programming assignment. This is the next step in our evaluation process.

You are free to implement the assignment using whatever programming language and libraries you want. It is designed so it may take several days to complete, assuming a candidate cannot spare more than a couple of hours a day. We are looking for quality, not a quick prototype.

Taking into account your schedule, please provide an estimate of how long it might take you to finish. You are welcome to ask me any questions.
